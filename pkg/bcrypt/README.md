# Bcrypt package

A slightly modified bcrypt package of https://github.com/golang/crypto/tree/master/bcrypt .

This package makes functions to create a hash with a given salt available.

This package does not change the general algorithm of this hash.

**We do not recommended importing this package. You better should use the original package (golang.org/x/crypto/bcrypt).**
